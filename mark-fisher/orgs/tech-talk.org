* FujiNet

** Reignited passion for 8-bit

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- First got Atari 400, then 800XL in the 1980s
- Mac65 and Action!
- Still using it at Uni up to 1990
- Moved onto Amiga, and then PCs, the Atari got lost in house moves
- Bought an 800XL in September 2020 as lockdown project
- Maxed it out with U1MB, Sophia 2, SIDE3
- In October 2020 Discovered Fujinet and bought one, joined discord shortly after

** Open Project

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Can simply clone the project, make changes, and flash your FN
- Very easy to contribute, looking for more contributors

** Host software was a bit of a mess

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Lots of copies of similar code, copied and pasted, bugs repeated
- Very little rigour, lots of styles
- Lots of boiler plate, actual functionality difficult to see
- Difficult to write simple applications

** Needed a common library

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- fujinet-lib born!
- Initially atari
- Extended to apple2
- More to come (c64, spectrum, dragon32, coco, ...)

* Writing a cross platform library

** cc65 - cross platform compiler

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Supports many 6502 systems
- Can use PCs to create apps for 8 bit machines

** Testing Library Using BDD6502

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Cucumber testing framework by Martin Piper
- Java application that uses Symon 6502 emulator
- Testable 6502 code with BDD tests!

** I can test my 6502 library!

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Most of it is in ASM
- Caught hundreds of bugs, and allowed me to see the code as test ran.
- Invaluable as tool for developing library.

** Atari #1

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Easy target, I have one!
- There's an amazing emulator (Altirra)
- Cobined with with emulated fujinet (fujinet-pc)
- Iterating over changes is quick



** Apple2 next target

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- No emulator with fujinet support
- I'd never even seen an Apple2
- BBC "Beeb" was the school computer of choice
- Virtually no A2s in UK
- Using previous examples of a2 applications, I wrote the library blind

#+REVEAL: split

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- How to test it though?
- Ben (@superbenk) ran my applications on his machine (Sept-Oct 2023)
- Time lag! Felt like 60s with punch cards
- Weeks of uploading PO files to discord, wait for them to be tested with screen shots and logs
- Better solution?
- Extend AppleWin Emulator to support Fujinet Emulator!
- Running out of fingers to count layers between the application and where it was running
- Eric Carr had done some basic changes to AppleWin to support AppKeys for his 5CS program

#+REVEAL: split

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- In comes Oliver Schmidt
- The guru (or GOAT) of all things A2!
- Many years of supporting cc65
- Developing A2RetroNet and A2Pico projects
- Proposed a mechanism for SmartPort over SLIP (Oct 2023)
- I implemented it!

* AppleWin Emulator

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Very functional and extendible Emulator
- Has a Linux port (rather than running just on WINE)
- Would allow me to extend fujinet-lib for apple2 and test it without punchcard approach
- Would give us parity between Atari and Apple2 as supported platforms for virtual FN
- Just your PC and you can write applications that run on multiple 8 bit machines tested virutally

** Initially supported just fujinet-network

- Could run fujinet specific applications that used fujinet-lib (Dec 2023)
- Couldn't load 'disks' or treat FujiNet as SmartPort device

** Implementing SmartPort in AppleWin

- 25th Jan 2024 - Added Block Reading/Writing to Emulator
- FujiNet Config booted!
