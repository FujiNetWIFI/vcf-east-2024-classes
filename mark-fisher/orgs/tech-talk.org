- First got Atari 400, then 800XL in the 1980s
- Mac65 and Action!
- Still using it at Uni up to 1990
- Amiga, to PCs. Atari got lost in house moves ðŸ˜

:reveal_background_opacity: 0.1
:END:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

- Initially atari
- Extended to apple2
- More to come (c64, spectrum, dragon32, coco, ...)

* Writing a cross platform library
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./images/tech-talk/8bit-machines.jpg
:reveal_background_opacity: 0.1

- Need framework that:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  + Supports multiple platforms
  + Be reliable and easy to use

- Can use PCs to create apps for 8 bit machines
- Been around for decades
- We have some resident experts
- Can write ASM or C directly

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Most of it is in ASM
- Caught many bugs
- Watch code as it runs
- Invaluable for developing library

** First Target: Atari
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./images/tech-talk/8bit-machines.jpg
:reveal_background_opacity: 0.1
:END:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Easy target, I have one!
- There's an amazing emulator (Altirra)
- Combined with with emulated fujinet
  - Amazing work by @apc (fujinet-pc)
- Iterating over changes is quick


** Second Target: Apple2
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./images/tech-talk/8bit-machines.jpg
:reveal_background_opacity: 0.1
:END:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Two immediate problems
- No emulator with fujinet support
- I'd never even seen an Apple2
  - BBC "Beeb" was the school computer of choice
- Virtually no A2s in UK - Expensive imports
- fujinet-apps had examples
- I wrote the library with just unit tests

#+REVEAL: split

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- How to test it on real h/w though?
- Ben (@superbenk) ran my apps (Sept 2023)
- Felt like 60s with punch cards
- Screen shots and logs ðŸ™€
- Better solution?
- Get AppleWin Emulator to support Fujinet Emulator!
- Eric Carr showed the way (appkeys)
- ... also come to US and pick one up

#+REVEAL: split

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- In comes Oliver Schmidt
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - A2 GOAT, extremely knowledgable
  - Many years of supporting cc65
  - Developing A2RetroNet & A2Pico
- Proposed a mechanism for SmartPort over SLIP (Oct 2023)
- Carefully and slowly explained how A2 IO works
- I implemented it!
- ... while on holiday in France
- ... with my wife ðŸ«£

* AppleWin Emulator
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./images/tech-talk/jobs_wozniak.webp
:reveal_background_opacity: 0.1
:END:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Functional and extendable Emulator (C++)
- Linux port (not just on WINE)
- No more punch cards!
- Cross platform apps: Atari and Apple2
- No 8-bit computers needed anymore!

** First Iteration
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./images/tech-talk/jobs_wozniak.webp
:reveal_background_opacity: 0.1
:END:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Initially just fujinet apps (Dec 2023)
- No SmartPort support
- I didn't understand SmartPort
- ... can write apps, so... good enoughâ„¢

** Second Iteration
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./images/tech-talk/jobs_wozniak.webp
:reveal_background_opacity: 0.1
:END:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Need to support SmartPort in AppleWin
- A lot (more) back and forth with Oliver
- But eventually...
- 25th Jan 2024 - SP Disk support ðŸŽ‡

** FujiNet Config booted!

#+CAPTION: Config on A2

- Emulator can now run apps via FN
- Bootable disks from fujinet-lib code

** Still more to do

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- CP/M, Clock not yet supported
- Come join us!

* Final Musings

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- What a journey!
- Extremely satisfying to produce apps using modern s/w
- Never thought as 12 year old I'd be still doing Atari in my 50s
- You can try your curiosity out without buying hardware
- @superbenk has VM can download with everything setup on it
- We're just starting
- Come join us (have I said that already?)
- Come see us at the FujiNet stand
